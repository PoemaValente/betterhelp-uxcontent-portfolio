# UX Content Portfolio — Poema Meyer

This repository contains UX content samples created for therapist-facing,
regulated mental-health product workflows.

## Included samples
- In-product UX copy for a therapist documentation workflow
- Product-driven email announcing documentation workflow updates
- Reusable UX content patterns for regulated workflows

These samples demonstrate my approach to clarity, ethical language,
and UX content design in sensitive domains.
